          <p><b>Title:</b> The Data Dilemma in Designing Low-Cost, High-Precision Wearables for Users’ Wellness Tracking</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b> When designing wearables for individuals’ everyday wellness tracking, balancing device affordability with the need for accurate and privacy-preserving interpretation of sensor data is key. I will address in this talk recent works that directly address this by exploring strategies that span sensor design, data annotation, multimodal fusion, and privacy-aware processing. Own work on wearable sensing such as DeepPPG, WESAD, or WEAR illustrate the impact that sensor-specific methods can have, while studies in (federated) fitness tracking, hand washing, or epilepsy seizure detection show the challenges and promises in actual deployments. I’ll finally show some hands-on examples of embedded wearable platforms and the importance of open-source, reproducible tools.</p>

          <p><b>Title:</b> Computational Behavior Analysis for Wellbeing Assessments — Smart Entities (Devices, Algorithms, Humans) are Pushing the Boundaries of Digital Health.</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b> Many aspects of both mental and physical wellbeing are linked to a human's behavior and activities, i.e., what a person is doing and when, and how this changes over time. As such, human activity recognition using wearable and other pervasive sensing methods (HAR) is a pillar of mobile and ubiquitous computing based, out-of-clinic wellbeing assessments in various shapes and forms. Alas, recognizing what a person does is—to this day—a non-trivial endeavor due to the underlying analysis of multi-variate, noisy sensor data, which constitutes a formidable machine learning problem that the research community has been tackling.
          
          In this talk I will first summarize what makes HAR a hard machine learning problem and then discuss how recent technological breakthroughs can help to get closer to solving it. I will focus on opportunities to overcome data scarcity through cross-modality transfer, and self-supervised learning. I will then delve into some of the wellbeing assessments that my lab has been doing in areas such as Parkinson's assessment, automated analysis of eating behavior as proxy for mental wellbeing assessments, and recent work in behavior assessments for people with mild cognitive impairments.
            
          Finally, I will explore some more foundational thoughts on how we (should) characterize activities and behaviors and how language learning may help us to develop a more systematic and thus robust and generalizable understanding of human activities. I argue that human activities follow concepts that are similar to those of natural languages and as such these can be learnt, which will lead to improved modeling as well as analysis — as it is of importance, for example, for many medical applications.

Primary application domain for his work is computational behavior analysis where he develops methods for automated and objective behavior assessments in naturalistic environments, thereby making opportunistic use of ubiquitous and wearable sensing methods. Main driving functions for his work are "in the wild" deployments and as such the development of systems and methods that have a real impact on people's lives.

          <p><strong>Title</strong>: <b>Enabling Continuous Physiological Sensing on Ubiquitous Devices</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b> Personal health monitoring plays a pivotal role in reflecting lifestyle habits, detecting physical abnormalities, and tracking medical conditions and recovery statuses, thereby offering significant value for overall wellbeing. It is essential for integrating user-friendly and easily accessible healthcare services both inside and outside medical facilities, making it a key research area in human-computer interaction and ubiquitous computing. Traditionally, this field has relied heavily on medical-grade devices to collect physiological data, which are not only costly but also offer limited scalability, thus hindering their widespread use. This presentation will showcase our latest research efforts focused on achieving efficient and continuous physiological sensing with ubiquitous devices. Our goal is to provide new insights and innovative technological approaches within the realm of human-computer interaction for health.</p>
